  Laodicea was the most important cultural, art, trace, and sports center in
  antiquity. The city was designed with the Hippodamian grid plan. Sadly, In the
  5th century A.D., the city was demolished by a great earthquake. It was very
  popular with the trade of its wool, textile, and marble because Laodiceans
  were best at producing textile products.
