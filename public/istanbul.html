  Archeological findings suggest that humans may have lived on Istanbul's Asian
  side as early as 3000 BC. Eventually, at the point where the Bosphorus and the
  Golden Horn meet and flow into the Marmara (667 B.C. ), on the European side,
  Greek immigrants headed by Byzas founded the colony of Byzantium in the 7th
  century BC. According to a different tale, Byzas selected the location after
  speaking with the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, who advised him to settle across
  from the "land of the blind ones." Byzas came to the conclusion that the
  earlier settlers must have been blind in order to miss this excellent location
  at the opening of the Bosphorus strait. Byzas made a wise choice in doing
  this, as history has demonstrated that Istanbul's position is considerably
  more significant than these early Greek settlers could have imagined.

  It joined the Roman Empire in the early 100s BC, and Emperor Constantine the
  Great proclaimed Byzantium the capital of the Roman Empire in 306. The city
  was referred to as Constantinople after that.

<p>
  The empire experienced great turmoil in the middle of the fourth century AD.
  The eastern Roman Empire, often known as the Byzantine Empire, retained
  Constantinople as its capital while barbarians overthrew the western Roman
  Empire. The city was destroyed by antigovernment riots in 532, during
  Justinian I's reign. Outstanding buildings like the Hagia Sophia serve as
  reminders of the heights to which Byzantine civilization was able to rise once
  it was renovated.

<p>
  The city's greatest asset—its unparalleled position for trade and
  transportation across three continents—was also its greatest drawback. Over
  the course of the next several centuries, Constantinople was invaded by Arabs,
  Persians, people living on the move, and Fourth Crusade soldiers who briefly
  held power in the city.
