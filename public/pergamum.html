  Pergamum was a center of emperor worship, in fact, the Encyclopedia Britannica
  calls it the chief center of the imperial cult for some time. The picture of
  altar posted above belongs to the Roman emperor, Trajan.

  The array of gods and goddesses in this town was impressive for people in the
  antiquity such as: The altar of Zeus who was the king of Mount Olympus, where
  all the gods and goddesses dwelt. The temple of Dionysos who was the god of
  theater, wine and revelry. The temple of the goddess of Demeter who would
  guarantee the people food on their table and a wonderful crop at the end of
  the season. Maybe they needed wisdom and just didn't know what to do. Then
  came to the temple of Athena, the goddess of wisdom
